# Accelerated data science with R and Python

The RAPIDS suite of software libraries, built on CUDA-X AI, gives you the freedom to execute end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA CUDA primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposes GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces. RAPIDS also focuses on common data preparation tasks for analytics and data science. This includes a familiar DataFrame API that integrates with a variety of machine learning algorithms for end-to-end pipeline accelerations without paying typical serialization costs. RAPIDS also includes support for multi-GPU deployments, enabling vastly accelerated processing and training on much larger dataset sizes. This demonstration uses RAPIDS to analyze data, train models, and deploy saved models for inference serving. It will also demonstrate how to connect to RAPIDS via an experimental R API.
